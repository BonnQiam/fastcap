The build:

If you are building with MinGW, run "config mingw" from this
directory.  This changes the CFLAGS defined in src/Makefile.  See the
comments in that file for more info. 

Type "make all" in this directory.  This will build the fastcap and
accessory programs, and install the binaries in ./bin.  You can move
or copy the binaries to another location, such as /usr/local/bin, by
hand if desired.

The old config files are still around -- DON'T USE THEM except for
MinGW as above.  The present source files and default Makefiles will
work on any known reasonably modern system that is vaguely Unix-like,
including OS X, Cygwin, and of course Linux/*BSD.  If you have trouble
please report to stevew@wrcad.com.
